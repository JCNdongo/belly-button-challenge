Challenge: building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

After using the D3 json library to read data from the samples.json file, I created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to show the top 10 OTUs for each individual.

I created a bubble chart to show each sample, then displayed the sample metadata and each key-value combination. 

I created a dashboard to display all visualizations: https://jcndongo.github.io/bellybutton.github.io/
